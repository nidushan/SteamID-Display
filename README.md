This chrome extention will let you see steamIDs of the corresponding profile you are looking at.
You can even copy your friends SteamID by right-clicking and selecting *"Steam ID Display -- Copy SteamID"*.
The main purpose is to help admins find players ID
If you need more formats, visit steamid.io

## How it works?
You can click on the steamID highlighted in **white** and it will automatically copy that steamID to your clipboard.

## How to install?
I will upload this soon to chrome webstore, but getting a developer licence costs money... 
<br>For now you must manually do it.
1) Download and extract the folder: [Downloadlink](https://github.com/xNidushan/SteamID-Display/raw/master/SteamID%20Display.rar) You can download the winrar file from the repo itself. 
2) At the top right of Chrome, click More <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/E2q6Vj9j60Dw0Z6NZFEx5vSB9yoZJp7C8suuvQXVA_2weMCXstGD7JEvNrzX3wuQrPtL"> <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/QbWcYKta5vh_4-OgUeFmK-JOB0YgLLoGh69P478nE6mKdfpWQniiBabjF7FVoCVXI0g"> More tools <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/QbWcYKta5vh_4-OgUeFmK-JOB0YgLLoGh69P478nE6mKdfpWQniiBabjF7FVoCVXI0g"> Extensions.
3) Navigate to the <img src="https://i.imgur.com/loRQTvQ.png"> and select the "SteamID Display folder"
**NB You must keep the "SteamID Display" folder for the extention to work!**

**Gratitude to:**
<br>xPaw for providing a reliable steamID library
<br>Valve for providing an API

Note! Some things will be fixed or changed on a future update!
```
- Make the extension work for private profiles
- SteamID Display will only show steamID (STEAM_X:Y:ZZZZZZZZ) as other IDs aren't that common.
- Copy SteamIDs from friends management list.
```
