This chrome extention will let you see steamIDs of the corresponding profile you are looking at.
You can even copy your friends SteamID by right-clicking and selecting "Steam ID Display -- Copy SteamID".
The main purpose is to help admins find players ID
If you need more formats, visit steamid.io

## How it works?
You can click on the steamID highlighted in **white** and it will automatically copy that steamID to your clipboard.

## How to install?
I will upload this soon to chrome webstore, but getting a developer licence costs money... 

**Gratitude to:**
<br>xPaw for providing a reliable steamID library
<br>Valve for providing an API

Note! Some things will be fixed or changed on a future update!
```
- Make the extension work for private profiles
- SteamID Display will only show steamID (STEAM_X:Y:ZZZZZZZZ) as other IDs aren't that common.
- Copy SteamIDs from friends management list.
```
