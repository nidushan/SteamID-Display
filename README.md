# SteamID Display by Nidushan

You will see steamIDs of the corresponding profile you are looking at.
You can even copy your friends SteamID by right-clicking and selecting "Steam ID Display -- Copy SteamID".
The main purpose is to help admins find players ID
If you need more formats, visit steamid.io

**Gratitude to:**
xPaw for providing a reliable steamID library
Valve for providing an API

Note! Some things will be fixed or changed on a future update!
```
- Make the extension work for private profiles
- SteamID Display will only show steamID (STEAM_X:Y:ZZZZZZZZ) as other IDs aren't that common.
- Copy SteamIDs from friends management list.
```
